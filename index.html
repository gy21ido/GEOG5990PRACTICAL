        <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website for GEOG5990- Python for Geographical Information Analysis. This website shows the link to my GitHub repository for the Python Agent Based Modelling and instructions on how to run the codes within the GitHub page.</p>
        <h2>Files included in the repository</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Model code: contains information about the agents, iterations given to them, and stopping conditions that ensure model is run efficiently.</li>
            <li> The Agent class code: agents are built and all behaviours such as how they move, share with their neighbours, eat, and breed to populate themselves.Two agent classes were created;  one for the agents, and another for their predators (wolves).</li>
            <li>The Environment code: the space within which the agents and their predators (wolves) behave and interact with themselves. This is a raster grid of data, plotted with matplotlib to include colours. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The environment is shown below:</p>

        <h3>Instructions to run the code</h3>
        <p>
            The model was built within Spyder Development Environment; however, it can be run within any Integrated Development Environment with Python Interpreter. 
            The code requires the download of the in.txt within the GitHub website; this serves as data converted to csv file read as the environment. 
            Web-scrapped data is used as the agents, using the BeautifulSoup module; with spatial coordinates within the environment.
            For user interactivity, the code asks the user to input the number of agents as integer between 0 and 100, number of iterations between 0 and 200, and number of wolves between 0 and 50 as shown below:
            Sample code run with 10 agents, 100 number of iterations, and 20 wolves is shown below:
