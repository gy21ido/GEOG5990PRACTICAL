# AGENT BASED MODELLING
This repository is the online portfolio containing all codes and files for Agent Based Model written for the module **GEOG 5990 Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills**, in fulfilment of part of the requirements to achieve a MSc in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds.
## Contents list
Files included in the repository include: 
* Agentframework.py (the class code for the Agents)
* Wolfframework.py (the class code for Wolves- predator Agents)
* Model.py (the code for the agent-based model)
* environment.csv (file containing the environment where the agents interact with one another)
* total.csv

## What the Agent Based Model software is
The Agent Based Model (ABM) is an Object-Oriented Programming and iterative model where agents perform various activities among one another and between the environment they occupy. Generally, just as every man has a stop in their day-to-day activities when a limit is reached, so do agents in ABM. The ABM expects three key codes before it can run to expectation:
* ***_The Model code_***, a user interactive code where the model is set up, including information about the agents, iterations given to them, and stopping conditions that ensure model is run efficiently.
* ***_The Agent class code_***, where the agents are built and all information about them is included; for example, behaviours such as how they move, share with their neighbours, eat, and breed to populate themselves.In this model, two agent classes were created (one for the agents proper, and another for wolves (agents predators).
* ***_The Environment code_***, which is the space within which the agents behave as deem fit and interact with themselves. In spatial science,it is mostly a raster grid of data, plotted with matplotlib to include colours.
